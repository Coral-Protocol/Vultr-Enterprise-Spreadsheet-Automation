### Introduction

- The Vultr Track challenges you to build a web-based enterprise AI agent deployed on Vultrâ€™s cloud infrastructure using the Coral Protocol, an open, standardized framework for AI agent collaboration. Coral enables multiple AI agents to communicate, share tasks, and coordinate through a structured messaging layer with threads and mentions. 

- The purpose of this track is is to show how to setup and run Coral using Vultr Cloud and a simple demonstration of an agentic system to answer any queries with respect to any spreadsheet. The app reqquires either a spreadsheet and a folder path or upload in Drive or GitHub and provide a public URL.

- In this example we are using the Titanic spreadsheet: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev/pandas/main/doc/data/titanic.cs`.

- Agents:  [Coral Interface Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Interface-Agent) | [Coral Pandas Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Pandas-Agent) | [Coral ACIdev agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-AciDevMCP-Agent/tree/pydantic-ai)

### How to run step by step

### 1. Set up Vultr

<details>

- Sign up on Vultr and know more by looking into the [product documentation](https://docs.vultr.com/products)

- Choose and host an instance as per your system requirements (Ubuntu: 22.0.4 recommended)

- Open terminal in your laptop, SSH into the instance (check IP) and enter the password of your instance

```bash
ssh root@95.179.233.169
```
- It is also useful to connect to same instance by [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) which can help edit files within your server. Connect using your Vultr credentials after installation.

### 2. Setup Coral Server 

<details>

- After you are logged into Vultr from your terminal, it is time to setup the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server). Follow the steps given in repository to install.

<details>

<summary>Install Java if UNAVAILABLE in order to run Coral Server</summary>

Install Java

```bash

# Apt update
sudo apt update

# Install the JDK
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk

# Check version
java -version
```

Run Coral Server

```bash

./gradlew run

```

</details>


</details>

</details>

### 3. Setup the Agents


<details>  

- Terminate the Coral Server from above and start below steps.
- In this example, we are using the agents: [Coral Voice Interface Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-VoiceInterface-Agent) , [Coral Pandas Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Pandas-Agent) and [Coral ACIdev agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-AciDevMCP-Agent/tree/pydantic-ai).  
- Please click on the link and set up the agents by following the setup instructions in the repository.  
- Check the output below to see how the terminal will look after succesfull installation, keep in mind the directory you are at while doing `uv sync`.

### 4. Run the Agents

<details>

<summary>You can run the agents in dev mode via terminal.</summary>

#### 1. Dev Mode

<details>

- The Dev Mode allows the Coral Server and all agents to be seaprately running on each terminal without UI support.  

- Ensure that the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server) is running on your system and run below commands in separate terminals.

- Ensure that you have setup the `.env` file with required keys.  

Run the Voice Interface Agent

```bash
# cd to directory
cd Coral-VoiceInterface-Agent

# Run the agent using `uv`:
uv run  main.py console
```

Run the Pandas Agent

```bash
# cd to directory
cd Coral-Pandas-Agent

# Run the agent using `uv`:
uv run main.py
```
Run the ACIdev agent 
```bash
#cd to the directory
cd Coral-AciDevMCP-Agent

#Run the agent using 'uv'
uv run main.py
```

</details>

</details>

### 5. Example

<details>

```bash
You have to give a voice input like this
# Input:
ask the pandas agent to describe me the coloums for 'titanic.csv' 

#Output:
The agent will respond back with the column description.

#Input:
then you can ask it to send this information to the ACIdev agent and email to xyz@gmail.com with the subject of Data Description.

#Output:
The email will be sent.

```
